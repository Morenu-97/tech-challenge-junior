# Tech challenge junior - Candidate Brayan Moreno

Hello! My name is Brayan Moreno, and I'm a candidate for the Junior FullStack position. I really enjoyed the technical test. I learned a lot and reinforced programming concepts. I used JavaScript because it is the programming language I've the most experience with. Each file solves a challenge and includes an example use case along with a `console.log()` to visualize the output of the function.

Additionally, I created a utils.js file that contains reusable methods to achieve cleaner code.

Thank you in advance for giving me the opportunity to participate. I am very excited and eager to continue learning.
